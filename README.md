# Number-guessing-game-in-HTML...
 simple number guessing game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.


# How It Works:
# HTML Structure:
The page has a heading, an input field for the guess, and a button to trigger the guess-checking function.

# CSS Styling:
Basic styling is used to center the content and make the input and button look nice.

# JavaScript Logic:
A random number between 1 and 100 is generated.

When the user clicks the "Guess" button, the JavaScript function checkGuess() is called to check if the input is correct.

Feedback (too low, too high, or correct guess) is displayed in a <p> element.



# How to Play:
The player enters a guess in the input box and clicks "Guess."

The game will give feedback about whether the guess is too low, too high, or correct.

Once the correct number is guessed, the game shows the number of attempts made.
